BSO Ontology - Roles (1)</h1><p>Qualia roles are defined on entity types and argument roles are defined on  event types. Roles are inherited by subtypes, but subtypes can make restrictions  on roles  stricter or  more relaxed. Types define mappings from qualia roles or argument  roles (thematic roles) to types.</p><p>Entries under event types map grammatical roles to thematic roles, they do  not restrict the types directly. </p><blockquote><pre>[[Drink Activity]]  supertype = [[Take Nourishment Activity]]  #externalArgument = [[Animate Living Entity]]  #theme = [[Beverage]]'drink'  type = [[Drink Activity]]  #subjectRole = #externalArgument  #objectRole isa #theme</pre></blockquote><p>Entries under entity types do not provide mappings to qualia roles.</p><p><span class="emphasis">New feature:</span> Role mappings will beadded for entity-entries as well. It would restore symmetry to thequalia-argument distinction and make it possible to say that certainnouns express certain qualia roles in certain ways. The old system didall this stuff inside the parser.</p></body></html>
