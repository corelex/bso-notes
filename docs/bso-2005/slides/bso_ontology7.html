BSO Ontology  - Modifications</h1><p>Other potential modifications to the ontology structure:</p><ol>  <li class="question">Allow disjunctions in values</li>  <li class="question">Allow negation</li>  <li class="question">Create a distinction between mandatory and optional roles</li>  <li class="question">Introduce the notion of lexical sets</li></ol><p>The long-time goal is to completely merge   BSO and CPA. In that case, the representation language of   BSO will need to be expressive enough for all that's in CPA (or at   least all the things that are worthy).</p><p class="emphasis">New feature:<p> <blockquote>We will introduce disjunctions for certain fields. Vetted and agreedon so far are:<ol><li>disjunctions over an entire subcategorisation frame</li><li>disjunctions over values of individual roles</li></ol><p>It is undecided what alternations will be represented this way,some alternations may be better expressed by another mechanism likelexical rules.</p><p>For the record: the massive amounts of exploitations in the textwill not be dealt with (in disjunctions or any other vehicle), butregular alternations are fair game.</p></blockquote></body></html>
