BSO and BULB</h1><p>BSO and BULB are different things:</p><ol>  <li><span class="emphasis">BSO is a resource</span>. It consists of a type    system and a lexicon. There is GUI that allows us to browse BSO:    the BSO Browser. The BSO Browser will be extended  to include editing capabilities.</li>  <li><span class="emphasis">BULB is a graphical user interface</span>. It pulls    together information about entries from a series of sources, including BSO,    WordNet, PropBank, CPQ and others.    Each of those sources has its own tab (or series of tabs) in BULB. BSO is    one of the sources, and the BSO widget can choose to replicate the BSO browser.    BULB is a separate effort from BSO. </li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
