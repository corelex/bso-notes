BSO Ontology  - Roles (2)</h1><p><span class="emphasis">New feature:</span> We will allow entries toset restrictions on the types of roles. For example, "booze" is apeculiar kind of drinking and selects for a particular kind ofbeverage:</p><blockquote><pre>[[Drink Activity]]  supertype = [[Take Nourishment Activity]]  #externalArgument = [[Animate Living Entity]]  #theme = [[Beverage]]'booze'  type = [[Drink Activity]]  #subjectRole = #externalArgument  #objectRole = #theme = [[Alcoholic Beverage]]</pre></blockquote><p>The motivation here is to avoid subtyping for very idosyncraticbehaviour: one entry does not a type make. Will will not restrict thistyping to a subtype of the type specified on the type, but we willflag it if the entry specifies such a type.</p><p>Having entries restrict roles is not completely unprecedented in the BSO  because some entries already set remote type restrictions through bound arguments.  I'm not privy to the exact reasons for this, but avoiding an explosion of subtyping  must have been one.</p><blockquote><pre>[[Writer]] { #telic = [[Write Activity]] }[[Write Activity]] { #theme = [[Book]] }'novelist'  type = [[Write]]   (#telic -> #theme) = [[Novel]] }</pre></blockquote></body></html>
