BSO Ontology - Events</h1><p>BSO has about 1200 event types. It seems that the event hierachy    is in worse shape than the entity hierarchy. Many design decisions were constrained  by the intended application. We may not be able to salvage a lot.</p><p>The new event hierarchy will start off as a very flat structure, depth    can be added when CPA informs us that several entries can be grouped. That    is, structure of the hierarchy is governed not by theoretical constraints  but by distribution data in the corpus.</p><p>Addition of entries is driven by CPA:</p><ol><li><p>We'll start with the approx. 1000 patterns that CPA has as of now,   checking what BSO event types they refer to and creating a small   hierarchy from them. Some of this work has already been done by   Patrick and Anna in Berlin.</p><p class="question">Should we immediately add the 100 verbs that carry   the patterns?</p></li><li>Then take the PropBank verbs and NomBank relations and choose    types from them, renaming and creating types at will.</li><li>Use analyses from CPA to determine role structure.</li></ol><p>Here's a P. Hanks real life example:</p> <blockquote>A PropBank entry like "abandon" has two types: [[Relinquish Activity]]and [[Leave Activity]], but the subcategorisation frames are thesame. The editor here has the option to (i) merge the types, (ii)create a new type with both types as supertypes, (iii) or do somethingentirely different that seems liek a good idea.  </blockquote></body></html>
