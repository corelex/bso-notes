BSO and CPA (1)</h1><p>BSO and CPA are developed ate the same time, using two different tools. But  BSO and CPA depend on each other:</p><ol>  <li>CPA patterns refer to types in BSO</li>  <li>CPA patterns suggest changes to the BSO ontology</li>  <li>CPA is a major driving force in the creation of the event hierarchy</li></ol><p>We need a workflow that allows independent editing, yet avoids changing elements  in one resource that are required by the other. The saving grace is that the  dependency is not symmetric: CPA feeds into BSO and generates requirements  for BSO. </p><p>Approach:</p><blockquote>  <p>Add information to BSO that informs the editor that certain types and entries    are relevant to CPA. Keep this information to a minimum so we won't find    ourselves in maintenance nightmare.</p></blockquote><p>CPA editing is web-based, based on Firefox plugins and thereforeaccesable only from Firefox. Pavel says is it no problem to createpure standard HTML pages for CPA browsing.</p><p class="question">Should BSO editors have access to information from    CPA that is not in the BSO? What should be communicated from CPA    to BSO?  How should it be communicated and where should it be    stored?</p><blockquote><p>Some examples of what may need to be communicated are on thenext slides. Other example are suggestions like: (i) get rid of thetype [[DisplayThis]], which is, with [[Imaginary Living ChristamsEntity]], one of the finer types in the BSO, (ii) [[Beverage]] is agreat type but it has to be a subtype of [[Liquid]].</p><p>A suggestion from Pavel: "The best possible way is a URL (CGIscript in BULB) which gives XML encoded data (tree) with all types andsupertypes for a word. In that case, CPA software can provide aclickable list(s) for each element of a CPA pattern.  CPA data arestored on Brno server (aurora.fi.muni.cz) and can be provided insimilar way."</p></blockquote></body></html>
