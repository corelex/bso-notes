BSO and CPA (3)</h1><p>Another  scenario:</p><ol>  <li>A lexicographer analyses the corpus patterns for &quot;drink&quot; and    sees the sentence: &quot;he drank beer&quot;. He clicks &quot;beer&quot; and    up pops the familiar list. </li>  <li>He finds the      type [[Beverage]] and decides that the type is fine, but that only a subset    of its lexical entries is relevant. Say, &quot;beer' and &quot;ale&quot; are fine, but &quot;ginger    ale&quot; and &quot;lager&quot; are not fine, but they are good beverages, and of use in    other patterns. So the lexicographer creates a pattern like this    <blockquote>drink_3: [[Person]] drinks [[Beverage]] {&quot;beer&quot;, &quot;ale&quot;}</blockquote>  </li>  <li>BSO gets notified automatically of this action, possibly by adding two	    entries to a table associated with the BSO entries:	  <blockquote>	    <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">	      <tr>	        <td>entry</td>	        <td>type</td>	        <td>pattern</td>	        <td>role</td>          </tr>	      <tr>	        <td>beer</td>	        <td>Beverage</td>	        <td>drink_3</td>	        <td>object</td>          </tr>	      <tr>	        <td>ale</td>	        <td>Beverage</td>	        <td>drink_3</td>	        <td>object</td>          </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>	      <p>These entries suggest to a BSO editor that &quot;beer&quot; and &quot;ale&quot;, of type        [[Beverage]] are rather useful entries with a usefull type and that they        should not be changed lightly.        CPA should        be        consulted        or warned when the BSO types are changed.</p>  </li></ol></body></html>
