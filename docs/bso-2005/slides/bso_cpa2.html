BSO and CPA (2)</h1><p>Here's a simple scenario:</p><ol>  <li>A lexicographer analyses the corpus patterns for &quot;drink&quot; and    sees the sentence: &quot;he drank beer&quot;</li>  <li>He clicks &quot;beer&quot; and up pops a list from BSO with all types and supertypes    for &quot;beer&quot;. For each type, a list of entries can be displayed. </li>  <li>He finds the      type [[Beverage]] and decides that that type, with its entries, captures      a normal use of &quot;drink&quot;, and that the following pattern can be      created:	  <blockquote>drink_2: [[Person]] drinks [[Beverage]] </blockquote>  </li>  <li>BSO gets notified automatically of this action, possibly by adding two	    entries to a table associated with the BSO types:	  <blockquote>	    <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">	      <tr>	        <td>type</td>	        <td>pattern</td>	        <td>role</td>          </tr>	      <tr>	        <td>Person</td>	        <td>drink_2</td>	        <td>subject</td>          </tr>	      <tr>	        <td>Beverage</td>	        <td>drink_2</td>	        <td>object</td>          </tr>        </table>    </blockquote>	      <p>These entries suggest to a BSO editor that [[Person]] and [[Beverage]]        are rather useful types and that they should not be changed lightly.        CPA should        be        consulted        or warned when the BSO types are changed.</p>  </li></ol></body></html>
