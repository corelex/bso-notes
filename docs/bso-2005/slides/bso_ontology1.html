BSO Ontology</h1><p>There are three major types: Event, Entity and Property. Event and Entityare both subdivided according to the natural, functional, complex distinction.  Wewill for now ignore the Properties.</p><p class="emphasis">Entities</p><blockquote>  <p><span class="emphasis">Natural kinds</span> are things like &quot;rock&quot;, <em>&quot;</em>tiger<em>&quot;</em> and    &quot;stick&quot;.    They are what they are. <span class="emphasis">Functional</span> entities    are things like hammer, door and knife, they are artifacts made for a particular    reason. They're distinguished    from natural kinds by having a telic role. <span class="emphasis">Complex</span> entities    lead double lives, for example, &quot;turkey&quot; is both a food and an    animal.</p></blockquote><p class="emphasis">Events</p><blockquote>  <p>Events are split the same way as entities. The type of event is determined    by its arguments: the <span class="emphasis">most complex argument determines    the kind of event</span>. So an event with a natural kind argument and a    functional argument is itself functional.</p></blockquote><p><span class="emphasis">Role inheritance</span></p><ol>  <li>multiple inheritance is possible (<span class="question">do we set a limit of 2 or 3?</span>)</li>  <li>simple default inheritance (one supertype overwrites the other)</li>  <li>non-monotonic (subtypes can remove restrictions of roles, but cannot remove    the roles themselves).</li></ol></body></html>
