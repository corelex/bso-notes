BSO Ontology  - Consistency</h1><p>Consistency of types and entries is enforced in the sense that  types and entries may not refer to non-existing types. </p><p>Entries do not need to express all roles that are expressed on their types  (see entry_P below, which does not express the #theme role). </p><blockquote><pre>[[Type_X]]    #externalArgument = [[Type_Y]]  #theme = [[Type_Z]]'entry_P'  type = [[Type_X]]  #subjectRole = #externalArgument'entry_Q'  type = [[Type_X]]  #subjectRole = #externalArgument  #objectRole = #theme  #ppRole1 = #goal **</pre></blockquote><p>Also, we will allow for an entry to express roles that are not defined on  its type (see entry_Q above). Such a situation is sub-optimal and will be flagged  in the browser (here indicated with a double star). But outruling it is too  draconian and will hinder development of the ontology.</p></body></html>
